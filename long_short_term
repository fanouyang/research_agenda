### 2019 Mar 19
My long term research goal is to promote students' knowledge creation and self-development capacity through partnering 
with instructors and peers. 

To achieve this long term goal, I have worked on 1) instructor's engagement in an online learning 
community (2017) 2) students' collaborative knowledge construction in online learning (2018) 
3) the process of instructor-student collaborative partnerships in online courses (2018-2019). 

In addition, from the technique perspective, I 1) mastered primary learning analytics methods including SNA, CA, 
sequential analysis, text mining, etc. (2017-2018) 2) devised student-facing learning analytics tools (2018-2019).

Next, building on my long-term goal, my short-term objectives in 2019 include: 1) conduct an action research in my own 
classes to practice instructor-student collaboration (spring one course, summer two courses); write up the action research 
paper (one paper at a time), read and write when I conduct the action research 

2) partner with students on the revised tool development (make it real-time) and partner with colleagues to conduct 
experimental research in real classes
